# cursor-clone
Cursor Landing Page Clone is a desktop-first UI recreation inspired by the official Cursor website. This project focuses on structural accuracy, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy using only HTML and CSS. All major landing page sections were recreated, however original images/screenshots are not included in this repository.
